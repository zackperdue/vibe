# Vibe Language Syntax Reference

## Overview

Vibe is a dynamically typed language with Ruby-like syntax and TypeScript-style type annotations. This document outlines the official syntax rules that should be followed when implementing or modifying the lexer, parser, and interpreter components.

## Basic Syntax Elements

### Comments

Single-line comments start with `#`:

```ruby
# This is a comment
```

### Variables and Assignments

Variables are assigned with the `=` operator:

```ruby
a = 5
b = 10
c = a + b
```

### Data Types

#### Primitive Types

- **Integer**: `5`, `10`, `-3`
- **Float**: `3.14`, `-0.5`
- **String**: `"hello world"`, `'hello world'`
- **Boolean**: `true`, `false`
- **Nil**: `nil`

#### Arrays

Arrays are defined with square brackets:

```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Type Annotations

Type annotations follow TypeScript-style syntax, using colons after identifiers:

```ruby
x: int = 5
name: string = "John"
```

Available types include:
- `int`
- `float`
- `string`
- `bool`
- `any`
- `Array<T>` (generic array type)

## Control Flow

### If Statements

If statements use Ruby-like syntax with `end` to close blocks:

```ruby
if x > 5
  y = 10
else
  y = 5
end
```

Elsif can be used for additional conditions:

```ruby
if x > 10
  puts "x is greater than 10"
elsif x > 5
  puts "x is greater than 5 but not greater than 10"
else
  puts "x is not greater than 5"
end
```

### While Loops

While loops use the `do` and `end` keywords to denote their body:

```ruby
while x < 10 do
  x = x + 1
end

while x < 10 do; print x; end

```

## Functions

### Function Definition

Functions are defined using the `def` keyword with TypeScript-style parameter and return type annotations:

```ruby
def add(x: int, y: int): int do
  return x + y
end
```

Function parameters can include type annotations:

```ruby
def greet(name: string): string do
  return "Hello, " + name
end
```

Functions use `do` & `end` to denote their body.

### Function Calls

Functions are called with parentheses:

```ruby
result = add(5, 10)
```

## Output

Print to the console using `print` or `puts`:

```ruby
print "Hello"
puts "World"  # adds a newline
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`

### Comparison Operators

- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`

### Logical Operators

- AND: `&&`
- OR: `||`
- NOT: `!`

## Arrays and Indexing

Access array elements with square brackets:

```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
arr[2] = 10  # Sets the third element to 10
```



## Important Syntax Rules

1. **Block Termination**: Control flow structures (if, while) and functions use `end` to terminate blocks
2. **Semicolons**: Semicolons are optional at the end of statements
3. **Type Annotations**: Follow variable or parameter names with a colon and type name
4. **Return Type**: Function return types are specified after the parameter list with a colon

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing or modifying components of the Vibe language:

1. The lexer should recognize all tokens according to this syntax specification
2. The parser should enforce the Ruby-like block structure while accommodating TypeScript-style type annotations
3. The interpreter should respect the type annotations for type checking
4. Error messages should be clear about syntax violations

This document should be consulted when making changes to ensure consistency across the language implementation.



Thought for
60s
Expand for details
To help implement a struct in the Vibe language with a Ruby-like syntax and functionality similar to Go's structs, we need to extend the existing syntax outlined in the Vibe Language Syntax Reference. Go's structs are composite data types that group fields with types and can have associated methods, while Vibe combines Ruby-like syntax with TypeScript-style type annotations. Below, I propose a syntax extension for structs, including how to define them, create instances, access fields, and define methods, ensuring compatibility with Vibe’s existing rules.

Syntax Extension for Structs in Vibe

1. Struct Definition

A struct is a new construct in Vibe, defined using the struct keyword followed by an identifier (the struct’s name) and a block of field declarations and optional method definitions, terminated by end. Fields are declared with TypeScript-style type annotations (e.g., field: type), consistent with Vibe’s variable and parameter syntax. Methods, if included, are defined using Vibe’s existing def syntax within the struct block.

Syntax:

text
Wrap
Copy
struct_definition ::= "struct" identifier [fields_and_methods] "end"
fields_and_methods ::= (field_declaration | method_definition)*
field_declaration ::= identifier ":" type_identifier
method_definition ::= "def" identifier "(" [parameter_list] ")" ":" type_identifier "do" [statements] "end"
Fields: Declared as name: type, where type can be any Vibe type (e.g., int, string, Array<int>).
Methods: Defined with def, following Vibe’s function syntax, with an implicit self parameter (see below).
Example:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
struct Person
  name: string
  age: int
end
2. Instance Creation

Instances of a struct are created using the struct’s name followed by .new and a parenthesized list of arguments, mirroring Ruby’s instance creation style (e.g., Class.new). The arguments are positional and must match the order of the fields as declared in the struct definition. This leverages Vibe’s existing function call syntax with parentheses.

Syntax:

text
Wrap
Copy
instance_creation ::= identifier ".new" "(" [argument_list] ")"
argument_list ::= expression ("," expression)*
Arguments: Provided in the order of field declarations.
No named parameters: For simplicity, we stick to positional arguments, aligning with Vibe’s current function call convention (e.g., add(5, 10)).
Example:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
p = Person.new("Alice", 30)
3. Field Access

Fields are accessed using dot notation (e.g., instance.field), consistent with how Go accesses struct fields and intuitive for Vibe users. All fields are public by default, simplifying the design and aligning with Go’s approach to exported fields (though without the uppercase naming convention).

Syntax:

text
Wrap
Copy
field_access ::= expression "." identifier
Example:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
puts p.name  # Outputs: Alice
puts p.age   # Outputs: 30
Fields can also be assigned to using the assignment operator =, as with variables in Vibe:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
p.age = 31
puts p.age  # Outputs: 31
4. Methods

Methods are defined within the struct using Vibe’s def syntax. Inside a method, the instance is implicitly available as self, a keyword we introduce for struct methods, inspired by Ruby’s implicit self and Python’s explicit self. Fields are accessed within methods using self.field to distinguish them from local variables and maintain clarity.

Syntax (within struct):

text
Wrap
Copy
method_definition ::= "def" identifier "(" [parameter_list] ")" ":" type_identifier "do" [statements] "end"
Implicit self: Refers to the struct instance; no explicit receiver declaration is needed.
Field Access in Methods: Use self.field_name to access or modify fields.
Example:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
struct Person
  name: string
  age: int

  def greet(): string do
    return "Hello, my name is " + self.name
  end

  def have_birthday(): void do
    self.age = self.age + 1
  end
end
5. Method Calls

Methods are invoked on struct instances using dot notation, following Vibe’s function call syntax with parentheses.

Syntax:

text
Wrap
Copy
method_call ::= expression "." identifier "(" [argument_list] ")"
Example:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
p = Person.new("Alice", 30)
puts p.greet()  # Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice
p.have_birthday()
puts p.age      # Outputs: 31
Complete Example

Here’s a full example demonstrating the proposed struct implementation in Vibe:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
struct Person
  name: string
  age: int

  def greet(): string do
    return "Hello, my name is " + self.name
  end

  def have_birthday(): void do
    self.age = self.age + 1
  end
end

# Create an instance
p = Person.new("Alice", 30)

# Access fields
puts p.name  # Outputs: Alice
puts p.age   # Outputs: 30

# Call methods
puts p.greet()  # Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice
p.have_birthday()
puts p.age      # Outputs: 31
Implementation Notes

To integrate this into Vibe’s lexer, parser, and interpreter:

Lexer:
Add struct and self as keywords.
Recognize .new as part of instance creation tokens.
Parser:
Extend the grammar to parse struct definitions, including fields and methods.
Recognize identifier.new(...) as an instance creation expression.
Parse self.field within method bodies, ensuring self is only valid inside struct methods.
Handle dot notation for field access and method calls.
Interpreter:
Represent a struct as a type with a list of field names and types, plus a method table.
Implement .new as an implicit constructor that initializes fields in order.
Store instance data (field values) and provide access via dot notation.
For method calls, bind self to the instance and execute the method body.
Type Checking:
Validate that arguments to .new match the field types.
Ensure method return types and parameter types align with annotations.
Design Rationale

Ruby-like Syntax: Using struct Name ... end and .new aligns with Ruby’s block-based and instance creation conventions.
Go-like Functionality: Structs group typed fields and support methods, with public field access mimicking Go’s simplicity.
Vibe Consistency: Type annotations (name: string), def for methods, and dot notation fit seamlessly with the existing syntax.
Simplicity: Positional arguments for .new and public fields avoid complicating the language with named parameters or visibility modifiers initially.
This proposal provides a straightforward way to implement structs in Vibe, balancing the goals of Ruby-like syntax and Go-like functionality while adhering to the provided syntax reference.





Also using our syntax, lets create a class definition with usage examples



Thought for
25s
Expand for details
To create a class definition with usage examples in Vibe, we’ll use a syntax that blends Vibe’s Ruby-like structure with TypeScript-style type annotations, as established in its design. Vibe supports object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes, including field declarations, methods, instance creation, and inheritance. Below, I’ll define a class, explain its components, and provide examples of how to use it.

Class Definition Syntax in Vibe

In Vibe, a class is defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name and a block containing field declarations and method definitions, ending with end. Fields require type annotations, and methods are defined with the def keyword, similar to functions but scoped to the class. Instances are created with .new, and an optional initialize method can act as a constructor.

Here’s a basic class definition for a Person:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
class Person
  name: string
  age: int

  def initialize(n: string, a: int): void do
    self.name = n
    self.age = a
  end

  def greet(): string do
    return "Hello, I'm " + self.name
  end

  def get_age(): int do
    return self.age
  end
end
Breakdown of the Syntax:

Fields: name: string and age: int declare instance variables with their types.
Constructor: def initialize(n: string, a: int): void defines how instances are initialized. self.name and self.age assign parameter values to the instance’s fields.
Methods: greet() returns a string, and get_age() returns the person’s age. self refers to the current instance.
Block Structure: do ... end encloses the body of methods, consistent with Vibe’s Ruby-inspired syntax.
Usage Example 1: Creating and Using a Person Instance

Let’s create an instance of the Person class and call its methods:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
# Create a new Person instance
p = Person.new("Alice", 25)

# Access fields directly
puts p.name  # Outputs: Alice

# Call methods
puts p.greet()  # Outputs: Hello, I'm Alice
puts p.get_age()  # Outputs: 25
Explanation:

Person.new("Alice", 25): Calls the initialize method with "Alice" for n and 25 for a, setting the instance’s name and age.
p.name: Accesses the name field using dot notation.
p.greet() and p.get_age(): Invoke the instance methods, which use self to access the instance’s data.
Usage Example 2: Inheritance with a Subclass

Vibe supports single inheritance using the inherits keyword. Let’s define a Student class that extends Person:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
class Student inherits Person
  student_id: int

  def initialize(n: string, a: int, id: int): void do
    super(n, a)  # Call the parent’s initialize method
    self.student_id = id
  end

  def greet(): string do
    return "Hi, I'm " + self.name + ", a student with ID " + self.student_id.to_string()
  end
end
Breakdown:

inherits Person: Makes Student a subclass of Person, inheriting name, age, and their associated methods.
student_id: int: Adds a new field specific to Student.
super(n, a): Calls the Person class’s initialize method to set name and age.
Overridden Method: greet() is redefined to provide a student-specific greeting.
Usage:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
# Create a Student instance
s = Student.new("Bob", 20, 12345)

# Access inherited and new fields
puts s.name        # Outputs: Bob
puts s.student_id  # Outputs: 12345

# Call methods (overridden and inherited)
puts s.greet()     # Outputs: Hi, I'm Bob, a student with ID 12345
puts s.get_age()   # Outputs: 20
Explanation:

Student.new("Bob", 20, 12345): Initializes a Student instance, using super to set name and age via Person’s constructor, and setting student_id directly.
s.name and s.get_age(): Inherited from Person.
s.greet(): Uses the overridden version in Student.
Usage Example 3: Multiple Instances and Flexibility

Here’s an example with multiple instances to show how classes handle different objects:

ruby
Wrap
Copy
# Create multiple Person instances
p1 = Person.new("Charlie", 30)
p2 = Person.new("Dana", 22)

# Interact with each instance
puts p1.greet()  # Outputs: Hello, I'm Charlie
puts p2.greet()  # Outputs: Hello, I'm Dana

# Create a Student instance
s1 = Student.new("Eve", 19, 67890)
puts s1.greet()  # Outputs: Hi, I'm Eve, a student with ID 67890
Explanation:

Each instance (p1, p2, s1) maintains its own state (name, age, student_id), demonstrating encapsulation.
The greet() method behaves polymorphically: Person instances use the base version, while Student instances use the overridden version.
Key Features Demonstrated

Class Definition: Fields and methods are defined within a class ... end block.
Instance Creation: .new creates instances, optionally calling initialize.
Field and Method Access: Dot notation (instance.field, instance.method()) provides access.
Inheritance: inherits and super enable subclassing and method overriding.
This class definition and its usage examples showcase how Vibe combines Ruby-like simplicity with typed, structured OOP, making it intuitive yet powerful for developers.





We also need to handle generics in classes



Thought for
24s
Expand for details
To handle generics in classes within the Vibe language, we need to extend its syntax and semantics to support type parameters, enabling classes to work with generic types in a way similar to languages like TypeScript. This allows for reusable, type-safe code while maintaining Vibe’s Ruby-like elegance. Below, I’ll explain how to integrate generics into Vibe’s class system, covering syntax, type checking, and practical examples.

Syntax for Generics in Classes
Class Definition with Generics

We introduce angle brackets <> to define type parameters in a class. These parameters act as placeholders for types that will be specified when the class is used.

Syntax:
text
Wrap
Copy
class <identifier><<type_parameter_list>> [inherits_clause] [fields_and_methods] end
<type_parameter_list>: A comma-separated list of identifiers (e.g., <T> or <K, V>).
These parameters can be used in fields and methods within the class.
Example:
ruby
Wrap
Copy
class Box<T>
  value: T

  def initialize(v: T): void do
    self.value = v
  end

  def get_value(): T do
    return self.value
  end
end
Here, T is a generic type parameter representing the type of value. The initialize method takes a parameter of type T, and get_value returns a value of type T.
Creating Instances with Generic Types

When instantiating a generic class, you specify concrete types for the type parameters using angle brackets.

Syntax:
text
Wrap
Copy
<identifier><<type_list>>.new([argument_list])
<type_list>: A comma-separated list of concrete types (e.g., int, string).
Example:
ruby
Wrap
Copy
b = Box<int>.new(10)
This creates a Box instance where T is int, so value is an integer.
Generic Methods

Methods within a class can use the class’s type parameters or define their own additional type parameters.

Syntax for Method Type Parameters:
text
Wrap
Copy
def <identifier><<method_type_parameter_list>>([parameter_list]): <return_type> do [statements] end
Example:
ruby
Wrap
Copy
class Container<T>
  items: Array<T>

  def add<U>(item: U): void do
    # Logic to handle U
  end
end
Here, T is the class’s type parameter, and U is a method-specific type parameter.
Type Checking for Generics
Type Parameter Resolution

When defining a class, the type parameters (e.g., T) are stored and available within its scope.
At instantiation, the concrete types (e.g., int in Box<int>) are mapped to the type parameters.
Type Substitution

For each instance, the type parameters are replaced with the specified concrete types.
For example, in Box<int>, value: T becomes value: int, and all method signatures are updated accordingly.
Validation

Unbound Types: If a generic class is used without specifying types (e.g., Box.new(10)), an error should be raised.
Type Mismatch: Arguments must match the specified types (e.g., Box<int>.new("string") should fail).
Practical Examples
Example 1: Basic Generic Class

ruby
Wrap
Copy
class Pair<K, V>
  key: K
  value: V

  def initialize(k: K, v: V): void do
    self.key = k
    self.value = v
  end

  def get_key(): K do
    return self.key
  end

  def get_value(): V do
    return self.value
  end
end

# Usage
p = Pair<string, int>.new("age", 25)
puts p.get_key()   # Outputs: age
puts p.get_value() # Outputs: 25
This defines a Pair class with two type parameters, K and V, and creates an instance with string and int.

Example 2: Generic Method

ruby
Wrap
Copy
class Utils
  def identity<T>(x: T): T do
    return x
  end
end

# Usage
u = Utils.new()
result = u.identity<int>(42)
puts result  # Outputs: 42
The identity method is generic, accepting and returning a value of type T, specified as int during the call.

Example 3: Nested Generics

ruby
Wrap
Copy
class Wrapper<T>
  inner: T

  def initialize(i: T): void do
    self.inner = i
  end
end

class Outer
  w: Wrapper<string>

  def initialize(): void do
    self.w = Wrapper<string>.new("nested")
  end
end

# Usage
o = Outer.new()
puts o.w.inner  # Outputs: nested
This shows a Wrapper class with a generic type T, used within Outer with string as the concrete type.

Implementation Considerations
Parser Updates

Recognize < and > for type parameters in class definitions and instance creation.
Parse and associate type parameters with classes and methods.
Interpreter Updates

Track type mappings (e.g., T to int) for each instance.
Apply these mappings when executing methods or accessing fields.
Edge Cases

Generic Inheritance: Support cases like class SpecialBox<T> inherits Box<T>.
Constraints: Optionally, add type constraints (e.g., T inherits SomeClass) in the future for more control.
Conclusion
By adding generics to Vibe’s class system, we enable developers to write flexible, reusable, and type-safe code. The syntax integrates seamlessly with Vibe’s Ruby-inspired design, using familiar <> notation. This enhancement makes Vibe capable of handling sophisticated data structures and algorithms while preserving its simplicity and elegance.





We also need class and instance methods



Thought for
25s
Expand for details
In the Vibe programming language, which blends Ruby-like syntax with TypeScript-style type annotations, you can implement both class methods and instance methods within classes. These allow you to define behaviors that either belong to the class itself or to instances of the class. Below, I’ll explain how to define and use both types of methods, complete with examples.

Class Methods
Class methods are methods that belong to the class itself, not to any specific instance. They are useful for operations that don’t depend on instance-specific data, such as utility functions.

Definition

Use the def self.method_name syntax, where self refers to the class.
Include type annotations for parameters and return types.
Usage

Call them directly on the class using ClassName.method_name().
Example

ruby
Wrap
Copy
class MathUtils
  def self.max(a: int, b: int): int do
    return a > b ? a : b
  end
end

# Calling the class method

```ruby
puts MathUtils.max(5, 10)  # Outputs: 10
```

In this example, max is a class method that compares two integers and returns the larger one. It’s called directly on MathUtils without needing to create an instance.

## Instance Methods
Instance methods are methods that operate on specific instances of a class. They can access and modify the instance’s data using self.

Definition

Use the def method_name syntax (no self. prefix).
Include type annotations for parameters and return types.
Usage

Call them on an instance of the class using instance.method_name().
Example

```ruby
class Counter
  count: int

  def initialize(): void do
    self.count = 0
  end

  def increment(): void do
    self.count = self.count + 1
  end

  def get_count(): int do
    return self.count
  end
end

# Creating an instance and calling instance methods
c = Counter.new()
c.increment()
puts c.get_count()  # Outputs: 1
```

## Important Syntax Rules

1. **Block Termination**: Control flow structures (if, while) and functions use `end` to terminate blocks
2. **Semicolons**: Semicolons are optional at the end of statements
3. **Type Annotations**: Follow variable or parameter names with a colon and type name
4. **Return Type**: Function return types are specified after the parameter list with a colon

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing or modifying components of the Vibe language:

1. The lexer should recognize all tokens according to this syntax specification
2. The parser should enforce the Ruby-like block structure while accommodating TypeScript-style type annotations
3. The interpreter should respect the type annotations for type checking
4. Error messages should be clear about syntax violations

This document should be consulted when making changes to ensure consistency across the language implementation.
