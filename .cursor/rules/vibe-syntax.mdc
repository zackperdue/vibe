# Vibe Language Syntax Reference

## Overview

Vibe is a dynamically typed language with Ruby-like syntax and TypeScript-style type annotations. This document outlines the official syntax rules that should be followed when implementing or modifying the lexer, parser, and interpreter components.

## Basic Syntax Elements

### Comments

Single-line comments start with `#`:

```ruby
# This is a comment
```

### Variables and Assignments

Variables are assigned with the `=` operator:

```ruby
a = 5
b = 10
c = a + b
```

Compound assignments are also supported:

```ruby
a += 5   # Equivalent to a = a + 5
b -= 2   # Equivalent to b = b - 2
c *= 3   # Equivalent to c = c * 3
d /= 2   # Equivalent to d = d / 2
e %= 4   # Equivalent to e = e % 4
```

### Data Types

#### Primitive Types

- **Integer**: `5`, `10`, `-3`
- **Float**: `3.14`, `-0.5`
- **String**: `"hello world"`, `'hello world'`
- **Boolean**: `true`, `false`
- **Nil**: `nil`

#### Arrays

Arrays are defined with square brackets:

```ruby
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Array elements can be accessed with square bracket notation:

```ruby
first = arr[0]  # Gets the first element
arr[2] = 10     # Sets the third element to 10
```

### Type Annotations

Type annotations follow TypeScript-style syntax, using colons after identifiers:

```ruby
x: int = 5
name: string = "John"
```

Available types include:
- `int`
- `float`
- `string`
- `bool`
- `any`
- `Array<T>` (generic array type)

## Control Flow

### If Statements

If statements use Ruby-like syntax with `end` to close blocks:

```ruby
if x > 5
  y = 10
else
  y = 5
end
```

Elsif can be used for additional conditions:

```ruby
if x > 10
  puts "x is greater than 10"
elsif x > 5
  puts "x is greater than 5 but not greater than 10"
else
  puts "x is not greater than 5"
end
```

### While Loops

While loops use the `do` and `end` keywords to denote their body:

```ruby
while x < 10 do
  x = x + 1
end

# Compact form is also supported
while x < 10 do; print x; end
```

### For Loops

For loops iterate over arrays:

```ruby
some_arr = [1, 2, 3]
another_arr = ["hello", "world"]

for i in some_arr do
  puts i
end
# 1
# 2
# 3

for s in another_arr do
  puts s
end
# "hello"
# "world"
```

## Functions

### Function Definition

Functions are defined using the `def` keyword with TypeScript-style parameter and return type annotations:

```ruby
def add(x: int, y: int): int do
  return x + y
end
```

Function parameters can include type annotations:

```ruby
def greet(name: string): string do
  return "Hello, " + name
end
```

Functions use `do` & `end` to denote their body.

### Function Calls

Functions are called with parentheses:

```ruby
result = add(5, 10)
```

## Output

Print to the console using `print` or `puts`:

```ruby
print "Hello"
puts "World"  # adds a newline
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulo: `%`

### Comparison Operators

- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`

### Logical Operators

- AND: `&&`
- OR: `||`
- NOT: `!`

## Important Syntax Rules

1. **Block Termination**: Control flow structures (if, while) and functions use `end` to terminate blocks
2. **Semicolons**: Semicolons are optional at the end of statements
3. **Type Annotations**: Follow variable or parameter names with a colon and type name
4. **Return Type**: Function return types are specified after the parameter list with a colon

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Currently Supported Features

- Basic variable declaration and assignment
- Compound assignments (`+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- Primitive types (int, float, string, boolean, nil)
- Arrays and array operations
- Basic type annotations
- If/elsif/else statements
- While loops
- For loops with array iteration
- Function definition and calls
- Print statements (`puts`, `print`)
- Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators

### üöß Partially Supported Features

- **Classes**: Basic class definition and instantiation syntax is defined, but implementation is incomplete
- **Inheritance**: Syntax is defined but not fully implemented
- **Generics**: Syntax is defined but not fully implemented

### ‚ùå Unsupported Features (Planned)

- **Modules/Imports**: For code organization
- **Exception handling**: Try/catch blocks
- **Structs**: For lightweight data structures
- **Advanced generics**: More complex type parameters
- **Standard library**: Built-in functions and utilities

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing or modifying components of the Vibe language:

1. The lexer should recognize all tokens according to this syntax specification
2. The parser should enforce the Ruby-like block structure while accommodating TypeScript-style type annotations
3. The interpreter should respect the type annotations for type checking
4. Error messages should be clear about syntax violations

This document should be consulted when making changes to ensure consistency across the language implementation.
